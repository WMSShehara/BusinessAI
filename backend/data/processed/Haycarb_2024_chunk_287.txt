range coconut growth yield. watersaving technologies, moreover, scenario presents lowest increase preparing waterrelated temperature. therefore, envisage impact emergencies coconut growth yield scenario. chronic increase precipitation long term projected physical risk lowest scenario. further, given precipitation resilience coconut wide range intensity distribution rainfall icarcentral plantation crops research institute india, envisage significant impact precipitation coconut crop yield. manufacturing locations tropical countries therefore, increased risk extreme precipitation events regions could give rise operational disruptions. however, since increase temperature scenario limited 1‚Å∞c, deem risk lowest scenario. chronic surface, ground, rainwater sources used physical risk industrial domestic requirements across geographic operational locations. availability sources physical water water could impacted climate change. availability drawdown groundwater table drying surface water
